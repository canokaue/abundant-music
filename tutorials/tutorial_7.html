<h2>Details - Custom Harmony</h2>
<p>If you want to design your own harmonic rythm, this is the tutorial for you!</p>
<ol>
    <li>Generate a new song!</li>
    <li>Create a custom song structure with just a single verse1. Set "Custom Harmony Indices" to 1 to modify the harmonic rythm to a custom one.
        Zero means "use default".</li>
    <li>Add a custom harmony that changes scale.</li>
    <li>Add voice line constraint for melody to end on something.
        This is an optional step but sometimes a phrase sounds a lot better if you end on the tonic or not on the tonic.</li>
    <li></li>
</ol>
