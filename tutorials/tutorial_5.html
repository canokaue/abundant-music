<h2>Domains - Phrase Group Types</h2>
<p>It is possible to control the generated song even more by modifying values in the "Domains" tab in the "Song Settings" dialog.</p>
<p>You can for example change the instruments to use for the different voices (melody, bass and inner), tempo range, the exact song
    structure to use and a lot more!</p>
<ol>
    <li>Generate a new song!</li>
    <li>Select the "Domains" tab</li>
    <li>Set the "Tempo Range" property to something low such as 40 50. This will give a random tempo between 40 and 50 beats per minute.</li>
    <li>Scroll down to the "Phrase group types" list. Here you can change the possible phrase types and corresponding likelihoods to use in your song.
        You can remove or add as many phrase types you want (and create your own if you go to the "Details" tab). For this tutorial, remove everything but
        "Modulate + complete", "Tonicize + complete", "Modulate + modulate back".</li>
    <li>Export and play the song! Now, all the phrases (except the fillers between phrase groups, intro and end) move between different scales.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can modify what similar scale to move to by changing "Major modulation/tonicization targets" and "Minor modulation/tonicization targets". Test for example
 to move to supertonic in major and subtonic in minor. Remember that you can change the scale type in the "Parameters" tab.</p>
<p>When you have deceptive cadences, the root to use as deceptive chord is modified with "Major deceptive root likelihoods" and the minor variant.</p>
