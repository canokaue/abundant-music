<h2>Sub-Seeds</h2>
<p>If you are not completely happy with your song, you can change it by setting so called "sub-seeds".</p>
<p>When you set a main seed, a lot of other seeds get set as well. For example, the rythm of the harmony is controlled by one such sub-seed.</p>
<p>If you find something in your song that you dislike, you can take a look in the "Structure Seeds" and "Content Seeds" tabs and enter a seed for
    the things you don't like.</p>
<p>Now, let's play with those seeds!</p>
<ol>
    <li>Enter a new, cool seed (or a random one) into the "Song" tab in the "Song Settings" dialog</li>
    <li>Listen to the song, especially the melody, by exporting it to your favourite format</li>
    <li>Now, let's pretend that you don't like the rythm of the melody. You want to change it!</li>
    <li>Find the "Melody Rythm Seed" in the "Content Seeds" tab and enter something. This new seed will override the default one and
        will modify the rythm.</li>
    <li>Export the song again and listen to the melody now! Is it better now? If not, change the seed again!</li>
</ol>
<p>If you feel adventurous, you can also experiment with the following seeds for the melody:
    "Melody Instrument Seed", "Melody Motif Seed", "Melody Connect Seed", "Melody Distribution Seed" and
    "Melody Harmony Punctation Seed"</p>
<p>Also, if you find a seed that you like very much, you can reuse it for other songs. You can for example create several songs with similar
    melodies but different song structure. Use the "Save" and "Load" buttons to save and load presets for the different song settings tabs.</p>
<p>If you want to see the actual or explicit seed that is generated by the main seed, press the small "E" button.
    You can also press the "Explicit Seeds" button to show all explicit seeds in that tab.</p>
