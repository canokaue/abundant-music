    <h1>Connected Songs Tutorial</h1>

    <p>
        Sometimes you may want to create several songs that are connected to each other in different ways.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, a game can have music in different contexts such as main/pause menu, calm gameplay, intense gameplay, combat, boss fight, success and failure.
        If you want these songs to feel as they were part of a larger musical "package", you might want to create musical connections between these different contexts.
    </p>

    <p>
        This tutorial explores the different ways that Abundant Music can support such connections between songs.

        <h2>Ideas</h2>
        <p>
            Reusing seed presets for motifs, rythms, instruments, song structure etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just a simple switch between major and minor while increasing/decreasing tempo can be very effective.
        </p>

        <p>
            Switching to more intense or strong instruments while increasing overall render amount.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unique levels with different instruments and motifs but same structure overall.
