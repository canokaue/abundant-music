<h2>Parameters - Song Structure Type</h2>
<p>Seeds are a fun and quick way to generate songs but sometimes you want more control of the output.</p>
<p>In the "Parameters" and "Domains" tab in the "Song Settings" dialog, you can find a lot of ways to control the generated song!</p>
<p>Do you want to change the scale type or time signature of the song? No problem! Just change the "Minor Scale Likelihood" or "Major Scale Likelihood".
    Change one of them to zero to guarantee the other one. Modify "4/4 Time Signature Likelihood" and so on to change the time signature.</p>
<p>Let's play with some parameters!</p>
<ol>
    <li>Generate a new, fresh song</li>
    <li>Change the "Verse Chorus Bridge Likelihood Multiplier" (in the "Parameters" tab) to something really high (like 99999) and listen to the song.</li>
    <li>Change the "Strict Build Likelihood Multiplier" to something really high instead and set the one you changed before to zero. Listen to the song.
        If everything went as expected, the songs should have different structures.</li>
    <li>Now try to set either "Minor Scale Likelihood" or "Major Scale Likelihood" to zero to change the scale of the song. Listen to the song!
        The songs should have the same structure,
    motifs and rythms but the scale is different.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a lot of parameters to try! Experiment and have fun :)</p>
